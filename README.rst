massedit
========

*formerly known as Python Mass Editor*

Implements a python mass editor to process text files using Python
code. The modification(s) is (are) shown on stdout as a diff output. One
can then modify the target file(s) in place with the -w/--write option.
This is very similar to 2to3 tool that ships with Python 3.


+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **WARNING**: A word of caution about the usage of ``eval()``             |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| This tool is useful as far as it goes but it does rely on the python     |
| ``eval()`` function and does not check the code being executed.          |
| **It is a major security risk** and one should not use this tool in a    |
| production environment.                                                  |
|                                                                          |
| See `Ned Batchelder's article`_ for a thorough discussion of the dangers |
| linked to ``eval()`` and ways to circumvent them. Note that None of the  |
| counter-measure suggested in the article are implemented at this time.   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Usage
-----

You probably will need to know the basics of the `Python re module`_ (regular
expressions).

::

    usage: massedit.py [-h] [-V] [-w] [-v] [-e EXPRESSIONS] [-f FUNCTIONS]
                       [-x EXECUTABLES] [-s START_DIRS] [-m MAX_DEPTH] [-o FILE]
                       [-g FILE] [--encoding ENCODING] [--newline NEWLINE]
                       [file pattern [file pattern ...]]

    Python mass editor

    positional arguments:
      file pattern          shell-like file name patterns to process or - to read
                            from stdin.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
      -w, --write           modify target file(s) in place. Shows diff otherwise.
      -v, --verbose         increases log verbosity (can be specified multiple
                            times)
      -e EXPRESSIONS, --expression EXPRESSIONS
                            Python expressions applied to target files. Use the
                            line variable to reference the current line.
      -f FUNCTIONS, --function FUNCTIONS
                            Python function to apply to target file. Takes file
                            content as input and yield lines. Specify function as
                            [module]:?<function name>.
      -x EXECUTABLES, --executable EXECUTABLES
                            Python executable to apply to target file.
      -s START_DIRS, --start START_DIRS
                            Directory(ies) from which to look for targets.
      -m MAX_DEPTH, --max-depth-level MAX_DEPTH
                            Maximum depth when walking subdirectories.
      -o FILE, --output FILE
                            redirect output to a file
      -g FILE, --generate FILE
                            generate stub file suitable for -f option
      --encoding ENCODING   Encoding of input and output files
      --newline NEWLINE     Newline character for output files

    Examples:
    # Simple string substitution (-e). Will show a diff. No changes applied.
    massedit.py -e "re.sub('failIf', 'assertFalse', line)" *.py

    # File level modifications (-f). Overwrites the files in place (-w).
    massedit.py -w -f fixer:fixit *.py

    # Will change all test*.py in subdirectories of tests.
    massedit.py -e "re.sub('failIf', 'assertFalse', line)" -s tests test*.py

    # Will transform virtual methods (almost) to MOCK_METHOD suitable for gmock (see https://github.com/google/googletest).
    massedit.py -e "re.sub(r'\s*virtual\s+([\w:<>,\s&*]+)\s+(\w+)(\([^\)]*\))\s*((\w+)*)(=\s*0)?;', 'MOCK_METHOD(\g<1>, \g<2>, \g<3>, (\g<4>, override));', line)" gmock_test.cpp


If massedit is installed as a package (from pypi for instance), one can interact with it as a command line tool:

::

  python -m massedit -e "re.sub('assertEquals', 'assertEqual', line)" test.py


Or as a library (command line option above to be passed as kewyord arguments):

::

  >>> import massedit
  >>> filenames = ['massedit.py']
  >>> massedit.edit_files(filenames, ["re.sub('Jerome', 'J.', line)"])


Lastly, there is a convenient ``massedit.bat`` wrapper for Windows included in
the distribution.


Installation
------------

Download ``massedit.py`` from ``http://github.com/elmotec/massedit`` or :

::

  pip install massedit


Poor man source-to-source manipulation
--------------------------------------

I find myself using massedit mostly for source to source modification of
large code bases like this:

First create a ``fixer.py`` python module with the function that will
process your source code. For instance, to add a header:

::

  def add_header(lines, file_name):
      yield '// This is my header'  # will be the first line of the file.
      for line in lines:
          yield line


Adds the location of ``fixer.py`` to your ``$PYTHONPATH``, then simply
call ``massedit.py`` like this:

::

  massedit.py -f fixer:add_header *.h


You can add the ``-s .`` option to process all the ``.h`` files reccursively.


Plans
-----

- Add support for 3rd party tool (e.g. `autopep8`_) to process the files.
- Add support for a file of expressions as an argument to allow multiple
  modification at once.
- Find a satisfactory way (ie. easy to use) to handle multiline regex as the
  current version works on a line by line basis.


Rationale
---------

- I have a hard time practicing more than a few dialects of regular
  expressions.
- I need something portable to Windows without being bothered by eol.
- I believe Python is the ideal tool to build something more powerful than
  simple regex based substitutions.


Background
----------

I have been using runsed and checksed (from Unix Power Tools) for years and
did not find a good substitute under Windows until I came across Graham
Fawcett python recipe 437932_ on ActiveState. It inspired me to write the
massedit.

The core was fleshed up a little, and here we are. If you find it useful and
enhance it please, do not forget to submit patches. Thanks!

If you are more interested in awk-like tool, you probably will find pyp_ a
better alternative.
